                    The Introduction to Python Course is a 5 session course (10-hour) program which exposes middle school students the basics of programming in Python, setting them up for success in a STEM-heavy future. Taught by me, a USACO Silver Competitor and 5-year
                    python programmer, and custom crafted to teach Python to students from 5th to 8th grade.

                <br />
                <p>Students are expected to spend about 30 minutes to 1 hour on the project each day. On the last day of the course, they will get about 30 minutes to 1 hour to ask any questions, and then they will showcase their final projects.</p>
                <p><i>As a reminder, students can always send me an email asking questions or requesting due date extensions. This isn't really meant to be a school, and I want to maintain a positive environment.</i></p>
